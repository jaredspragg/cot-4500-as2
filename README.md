 COT-4500 Assignment 2
Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given
data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the
dataset.
This helps us approximate points on complicated curves. The methods require tons of
operations on different points along the curve and introduces matrix operations.
